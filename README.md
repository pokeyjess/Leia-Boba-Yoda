# Rock, Paper, Scissors -- Star Wars style!

## Leia, Boba, or Yoda?

This is a simple game based off a Rock, Paper, Scissors implementation from my early days as a JavaScript student at Kenzie Academy. I figured I'd have a little fun with it.

To play, simply click on the character you pick. The computer, by generating a random number, will pick one of the three.

A window prompt will appear, showing how the two choices compare. Once you hit "OK", the page will automatically refresh and you can try again.

Nothing too fancy here. Just a little JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Credits

Like some of my other projects, I drew inspiration for my page from the Star Wars-themed color pallets found here: https://www.vox.com/culture/2015/12/17/10322514/star-wars-colors. In this case, I picked some colors from the "A New Hope" pallet.

My friend, Jason Hoyt, originally came up with the idea of doing a Star Wars version of Rock, Paper, Scissors. We are having an informal "competition" to see whose is best, and I hope to link to his repo once he has it up on GitHub so you can decide for yourself. Stay tuned!
